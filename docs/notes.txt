1. Above every controller therre should be written route. Which is the ultimate URL of Api endpoint. No matter what's the controller name is 

  [Route("api/Blah")]
  [ApiController]
  public class VillaController: ControllerBase
  {
      [HttpGet]
      public IEnumerable<Villa> GetVillas()
      {
          return new List<Villa>
          {
              new Villa { Id = 1, Name = "Pool View" },
              new Villa { Id = 1, Name = "Beach View" },
          };
      }

  }

Here: https://localhost:7214/api/Blah is the URL 


2. We CreatedDate only use in database but we don't expose that in end user. So Villa Dto doesn'thave created date but villa has
3. You cannot use same http verb two times. Without any proper parameters HttpGet, HttpGet("id")
4. To return specific status code you must have to use ActionResult as return type 
5. You can even use  verb parameter something like this - [HttpGet("{id:int}")] as parameter 
6. The annotation helps to document the status code  [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status404NotFound)]
